					<div class="content__text">The character first appeared in the 1992 four-issue miniseries Batman: Sword of Azrael[2] as Jean-Paul Valley.

He then became a supporting character in the monthly Batman titles, eventually taking over the role of Batman[3] through the "Knightfall," "Knightquest," and "KnightsEnd" story arcs. One of the creators, Denny O'Neil, admitted to having difficulties with Azrael's transition from villain to hero: "If I'd known he was to become a monthly character, I might have set him up differently ... The problem is that I had to turn a bad guy into a real hero, not just an anti-hero or lead. It's possible to do that, but it's difficult to retain the original characterization. You almost have to change his personality."[4]

The subsequent Azrael series, chronicling Valley's battles against the Order of St. Dumas, ran for 100 issues between 1995 and 2003. Starting with issue #47[5], it was retitled to Azrael: Agent of the Bat in an attempt to boost sales by tying the series in with the rest of the Batman mythos, including Azrael as part of the team of Batman, Robin, and the new Batgirl.

Michael Lane was introduced as a character called Azrael, introduced as part of the Battle for the Cowl, a storyline told in a three-issue miniseries format written by Fabian Nicieza.[6][7] This iteration of the character as a member of the Order of Purity has not been brought into the Rebirth era of DC.</div>

					<div class="content__text">DC vs. Marvel Comics (issues #2â€“3 titled Marvel Comics vs. DC) was a comic book limited series crossover published by DC Comics and Marvel Comics from April to May 1996. The series was written by Ron Marz and Peter David, with art by Dan Jurgens and Claudio Castellini.Two godly brothers who personify the DC and Marvel Universes become aware of the other's existence, and challenge one another to a series of duels involving each universe's respective superheroes. The losing universe would cease to exist. The story had an "out of universe" component in that the outcomes of primary battles were determined by readers voting. Numerous smaller, story-driven skirmishes occur throughout the series, not counted with the primary duels meant to determine the outcome between the brothers.</div>
